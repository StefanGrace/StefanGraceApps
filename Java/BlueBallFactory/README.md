# BlueBallFactory

My application has 2 items; a circle and a square, they come out of a pipe at the top, moving in a random direction. There is a button for creating each of them, and they will bounce when they hit the edge of the canvas or when they hit objects such as a windmill or a gate. When 2 circles collide they will disappear, when 2 squares collide they will also disappear, when a circle and a square collide, a circle or a square will be added at random. There is a stop button which will remove all items.
