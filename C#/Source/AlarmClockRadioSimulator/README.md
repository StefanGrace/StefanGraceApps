# AlarmClockRadioSimulator

I have made an alarm clock radio simulator in C#. Note that this is not suppose to be useful, it is just suppose to simulate what a real alarm clock radio would be like. I could have easily made it get the time from the OS, but I made it so you have to set the time manually to simulate what a real alarm clock radio would be like. This is not an exact replica of any particular model of alarm clock radio that actually exist, I made up the exact interface and functionality myself. 

I have also written an instruction manual to go with it, I have written the instruction manual as if it is for the physical product, not for the simulator.

Hold the Shift key while clicking any button to simulate long-pressing it. The brightness and volume sliders simulate the brightness and volume knobs, the list boxes simulate switches.
